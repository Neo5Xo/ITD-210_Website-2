      The health of our dogs in so important!!
      We feed our adult dogs top quality premium dog food.
      We supplement their diet with fresh meat, raw bones, organ
      meat and healthy supplements, including NuVet.   We continue
      this high standard of holistic and natural food with our pups
      by feeding them food which is  free of fillers and chemicals.
      We have many holistic tips and hints that we share with our
      puppy families with the goal of a healthy start and lifestyle
      for your dog.  We litter train our pups in addition to providing
      them with lots of outside playtime and housebreaking basics!!!
      Our pups are sold with a health guarantee.  We genetically test
      our adult Moms and Dads.  We test for  hip dysplasia, a
      structurally debilitating disease.
      We also test our adults for eye problems such as glaucoma and
      progressive retinal atrophy.  Our adult poodles are screened for
      a blood clotting disorder called vonWilldibrands disease.
      We provide you with a written 1 year guarantee on your pup.

      Our Goldendoodle  puppies  are raised with our family.
      They are born and nurtured in our home. We begin socializing
      our pups starting from day one. From the moment we whelp our
      pups, we work with them to be confident, smart, and trusting
      family members. They begin receiving visitors at 2 weeks of
      age.  From that point, they are held, kissed , played with,
      and taught by children, families, and friends. We invite
      people who have placed deposits to come & select their pup at
      about 4 weeks of age. Afterwords, we keep the pups until they
      are ready for you at about 7-8 weeks of age. This gives us time
      to keep working on socialization and housebreaking.
      <br><br>
      We raise our Goldendoodles as part of our family in preparation
      for your family.  Once you have selected your pup, you are
      welcome, and encouraged to visit.  This is great for
      socialization and often when our pups leave our home with their
      new families they already know each other….What a great stress
      reliever  for puppy, family, and us!!!!!!  We work hard on
      housebreaking as we provide lots of outside exercise and daily
      play.  We litter train our pups inside to help them learn the
      difference between their sleeping area, playing area & potty
      area.  In addition, we send our pups home with tips which
      include…crate training, housebreaking, grooming tips,
      recommended toys, and much more!
      <br><br>
      We offer a lifetime of support!  We give you our email and phone
      numbers.  We encourage questions and are glad to provide you
      with support and training tips…..All we ask is for pictures as
      we enjoy seeing our babies adjust to their families and grow up
      to be gorgeous Virginia Beach Goldendoodles!!!!
